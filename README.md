# Generative ai project

This repository contain some of the important generative architecture  models implemented in PyTorch from scratch. The code is well-documented with detailed explanations and comments.

- Variational  autoencoder (VAE)
- Simple Generative Adversarial Network (simpleGAN)
- Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN)
- Condiational Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN)
- Pix2Pix

## Tensorboard

To see result of training on tensorboard in real time : 

````
tensorboard --logdir=runs
````
You should have tensorboard installed and added to PATH environnement
